1. Go to Aws CodePipeline and create a new pipeline.
2. Specify whether you want to use Code Build or Jenkins. 
3. Specify the source of your repository.
4. Add A Buildspec.yml file in your project parent folder,  so that the pipeline can read it and build your project accordingly.
5. Specify which Aws service you need to deploy after the build is complete [mention the Aws beanstalk which you have earlier created].
6. Specify the type of deployment, i.e, Add the changes to one instance at a time or all at once etc.
7. Now whenever there is a change in our repo, it will automaticall trigger the CI/CD.
